# FreeTyle

## Project Description

Tile-based games are very popular for RPG indie developers (or for any developer that can use tile-based backgrounds for their games), but most software that exists to generate tile maps limit users to square tiles, making it difficult to have more natural looking regions without creating a ton of fixed-size images.

Also, it can be somewhat annoying, if not tedious, to have to create tiles with borders; to have bordered pieces, eleven to sixteen tiles must be created (depending on whether more than 2 sides need to be bordered for the area), and even more than this must be made for diagonal borders.

In its fully-developed form, this product would make it easier to create complex maps with fewer input images, and it would do all the work of cutting up the image into tiles for the user, generating any unique ones as necessary.
Also, it will be easy for users to make small changes to how an area looks without having to change any of their original images.

A text-based DSL is not ideal for this, but once it's in place creating a GUI should be fairly easy (though probably too time-consuming to happen in the scope of this project).
